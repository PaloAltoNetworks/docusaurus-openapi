Manages the time period for which a rule is active. For each schedule, you can specify a fixed date and time range
or a recurring daily or weekly schedule and then attach it to Security policy rules, QoS rules, or DoS rules.

By default, Security policy rules are always in effect (all dates and times). To limit a Security policy rule to a specific time period,
you can define a schedule and then apply it to the policy rule.
