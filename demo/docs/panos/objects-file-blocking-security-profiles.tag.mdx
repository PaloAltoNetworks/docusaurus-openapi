Manages File Blocking security profiles used to block users from uploading or downloading specified file types
or to generate an alert when a user attempts to upload or download specified file types.

You can define your own custom File Blocking profiles, or choose one of the following predefined profiles when
applying file blocking to a Security policy rule. The predefined profiles allow you to quickly enable best practice
file blocking settings:

* **basic file blocking**—Blocks files that are commonly included in malware attack campaigns or that have no real use case for upload/download.
* **strict file blocking**—Blocks the same file types as the other profile, and additionally blocks flash, .tar, multi-level encoding, .cab, .msi,
encrypted-rar, and encrypted-zip files.
