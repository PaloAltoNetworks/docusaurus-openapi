Manages external dynamic lists. An external dynamic list  is an address object based on an
imported list of IP addresses, URLs, or domain names that you can use
in policy rules to block or allow traffic. This list must be a text file
saved to a web server that is accessible by the firewall. The firewall
uses the management (MGT) interface by default to retrieve this list.




```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
