Manages interfaces acting as DHCP relay agents. DHCP relay agents enable a firewall interface to transmit
DHCP messages between clients and servers. Before configuring a firewall interface as a DHCP relay agent,
make sure you have configured a Layer 3 Ethernet or Layer 3 VLAN interface and that you assigned the
interface to a virtual router and a zone.
