Manages Antivirus security profiles used to block known malicious files (malware, ransomware bots, and viruses)
as they are coming into the network. The Antivirus profile has decoders that detect and prevent viruses
and malware from being transferred over six protocols: HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, FTP, or SMB.
You can set WildFire actions for all six protocols because the Antivirus profile also enforces actions
based on WildFire signatures.
