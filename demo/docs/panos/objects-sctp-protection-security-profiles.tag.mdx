description: SCTP Protection Security Profiles

Manages SCTP Protection security profiles used to validate and filter SCTP chunks on firewalls with SCTP Security enabled. An SCTP packet includes
a common SCTP header and a variable number of chunks, which can be control chunks or data chunks with encapsulated user data.

The firewall provides a multilayered approach for securing SCTP traffic, enabling validation of SCTP packets to ensure they comply with RFC 4960, filtering
of SCTP traffic based on payload protocol IDs (PPIDs), and granular-level filtering on Diameter traffic over SCTP and SS7
traffic over SCTP. You can also protect against flooding of SCTP initiation (INIT) packets. In the case of mobile networks, these security measures
prevent attackers from causing network congestion and outages that disrupt data and voice services of mobile subscribers and IoT devices connected to
these networks. Additionally, you can view SCTP logs, ACC information, and reports to verify configurations and gain visibility into the SCTP events
and traffic between two endpoints.
