Manages Zone Protection network profiles. A Zone Protection profile applied to a zone offers
protection against most common floods, reconnaissance attacks, other packet-based attacks,
and the use of non-IP protocols. It is designed to provide broad-based protection at the
ingress zone (the zone where traffic enters the firewall) and is not designed to protect
a specific end host or traffic going to a particular destination zone.
