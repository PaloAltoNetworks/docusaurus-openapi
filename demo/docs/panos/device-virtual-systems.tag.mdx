Manages virtual systems. A virtual system (vsys) is an independent (virtual) firewall instance
that you can separately manage within a physical firewall. Each vsys can be an independent
firewall with its own security policy, interfaces, and administrators; a vsys enables you
to segment the administration of all policies, reporting, and visibility functions that
the firewall provides.

A virtual system configuration doesn't control firewall-level and network-level functions.
For each vsys, you can specify a collection of physical and logical firewall interfaces (including
VLANs and virtual wires) and security zones. If you require routing segmenetation for each
vsys, you must create and assign additional virtual routers and assign interfaces, VLANs,
and virtual wires as needed.
