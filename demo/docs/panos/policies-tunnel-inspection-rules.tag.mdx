Manages Tunnel Inspection rules. Tunnel inspection rules allow you to match an incoming packet and specify the
tunnel protocols--GRE, non-encrypted IPSec, GTP-U, or VXLAN -- for which the firewall will inspect content and the conditions under
which the firewall drops or continues to process the packet.
