Manages the log forwarding options available to you. By default, the firewall saves logs locally. A log forwarding profile allows you
to specify whether traffic, threat, and WildFire Submissions log entries are forwarded to Panorama/Logging Service, and/or sent as SNMP traps,
syslog messages, or email notifications to other external destinations. In addition the log types listed above, you can use the log forwarding profile
to send enhanced application logs to the Logging Service (including traffic and url logs).

To enable a log forwarding profile, attach it to a Security policy rule.
