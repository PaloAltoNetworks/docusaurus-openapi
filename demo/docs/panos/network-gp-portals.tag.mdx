Sets up and manages a GlobalProtect portal. The portal provides the management functions for the
GlobalProtect infrastructure. Every endpoint that participates in the GlobalProtect network receives
its configuration from the portal, including information about the
available gateways and any client certificates that are necessary for the app to connect to a gateway.

You must use a unique name for each GlobalProtect Portal you create regardless of location.
