Manages Anti-Spyware security profiles used to detect command-and-control traffic (C2) initiated from malicious code running
on a server or endpoint and prevent compromised systems from establishing an outbound connection from your network.

You can also use the Anti-Spyware profile to the profile to enable DNS sinkhole and packet capture to help you track
down any endpoints attempting to resolve malicious domains.
