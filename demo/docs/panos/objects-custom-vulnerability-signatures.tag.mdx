Manages <a href="https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/objects/objects-custom-objects-spywarevulnerability.html">custom vulnerability signatures</a> used to identify vulnerability exploits. You can create custom
signatures by combining the signatures available on the firewall to create custom match conditions or
write custom regular expression patterns to identify spyware phone home communication or vulnerability exploits.
Content updates periodically include new decoders and contexts to help you develop custom signatures.

When you add the signature as a rule in an Vulnerability Protection profile, and then attach the Vulnerability Protection profile to a
Security policy rule, the firewall looks for the custom-defined patterns in network traffic and takes the specified action.
