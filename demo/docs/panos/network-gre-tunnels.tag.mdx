Manages Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels. The GRE tunnel protocol is a carrier protocol that
encapsulates a payload protocol. The GRE packet itself is encapsulated in a transport
protocol (IPv4 or IPv6). The GRE tunnel connects two endpoints in a point-to-point, logical link between
the firewall and a router (or another firewall).
