Manages SD-WAN policy rules. An SD-WAN policy rule enables you to control when and how the firewall performs application-based
SD-WAN path selection for a packet not belonging to a session. An SD-WAN policy rule uses application(s) and/or service(s),
a Path Quality profile, and a Traffic Distribution profile to determine how the firewall selects the preferred path for an
incoming packet that doesnâ€™t belong to an existing session and that meets its match criteria.
