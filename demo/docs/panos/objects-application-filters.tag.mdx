Manages application filters, which are used to create security policies based on application characteristics.
For example, a filter could match based on Category "business-systems" and Subcategory "office-programs".
Network access by any application with those two characteristics (such as Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365)
can then be enabled or disabled using a security policy defined by the filter. Future applications that match
the filter will also be automatically be managed by the filter-based security policy.
