Manages Decryption Forwarding profiles that enable the firewall to act as a decryption broker. A decryption broker firewall forwards
traffic that it has already decrypted and inspected to a security chain—a set of inline, third-party security appliances—for additional enforcement.
When the firewall receives traffic back from the security chain, it re-encrypts the traffic and forwards it to the appropriate destination.
See <a href="https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/decryption/decryption-broker.html">Decryption Broker</a> for more information.

Before you create a Decryption Forwarding profile to enable decryption brokering, you must:
* Enable SSL Forward Proxy decryption.
* Activate the free Decryption Broker license.
* Dedicate at least two Layer 3 interfaces on the firewall for forwarding decrypted traffic to the security chain (Network> Interfaces > Ethernet)
 After you complete these tasks, create a Decryption Forwarding profile to pair the two interfaces and define settings for the security chain to which
 the firewall will forward decrypted traffic.
