Manages SD-WAN Interface profiles.  An SD-WAN Interface profile groups physical links by Link Tag and
controls the speed of links and how frequently the firewall monitors the link. Each profile specifies
the Tag that you apply to the physical interface and also specifies the type of Link that interface
is (ADSL/DSL, cable modem, Ethernet, fiber, LTE/3G/4G/5G, MPLS, microwave/radio, satellite, WiFi, or
other). The Interface profile is also where you specify the maximum upload and download speeds (in Mbps)
of the ISPâ€™s connection. You can also change whether the firewall monitors the path frequently or not;
the firewall monitors link types appropriately by default.
