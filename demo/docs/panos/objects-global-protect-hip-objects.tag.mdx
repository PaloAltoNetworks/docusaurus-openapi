Manages HIP objects that serve as the building blocks for creating HIP profiles which
you can attach to Security policy rules.  HIP objects provide the match criteria for filtering the raw data reported by
an agent or app that you want to use to enforce policy. Keep HIP objects simple and match on one thing such as the presence
of a particular type of required software, membership in a specific domain, or the presence of a specific client OS.
