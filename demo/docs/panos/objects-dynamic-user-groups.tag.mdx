Manages dynamic user groups. With dynamic user groups, you can use tags to define groups that automatically contain
users who match the criteria you define. These groups enable you to mitigate risk when the data about a security incident
contains only a username. They also allow you to link users with information from log forwarding and risk assessment
applications, providing a more complete view of user behavior than you would see with user directories alone.




```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
