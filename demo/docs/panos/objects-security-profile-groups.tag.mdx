Manages Security Profile groups, which is a set of security profiles that can be treated as a unit and then easily added to security policy rules.
Profiles that are often assigned together can be added to  a security profile group to simplify the creation of security policy rules.

Naming a security profile group "default" triggers the firewall to attach the profile to all new security policy rules, further simplifying security policy
management.
