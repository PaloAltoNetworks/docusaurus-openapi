Manages GlobalProtect gateways, which provide security enforcement for traffic from GlobalProtect apps.
If the HIP feature is enabled, the gateway generates a HIP report from the raw host data the apps submit
and can use this information in policy enforcement. You can configure different types of gateways to
provide security enforcement and/or virtual private network (VPN) access for your remote users, or to
apply security policy for access to internal resources  network-gp-ipsec-crypto-network-profiles:
