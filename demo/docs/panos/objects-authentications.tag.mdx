Manages authentication enforcement objects that specifies the method and service to use for authenticating end users who access your network resources.
You assign the object to Authentication policy rules, which invoke the authentication method and service when traffic matches a rule.

The firewall has the following predefined, read-only authentication objects
* default-browser-challenge—The firewall transparently obtains user authentication credentials.
  If you select this action, you must enable Kerberos Single Sign-On (SSO) or NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication when you configure Captive Portal.
  If Kerberos SSO authentication fails, the firewall falls back to NTLM authentication.
  If you did not configure NTLM, or NTLM authentication fails, the firewall falls back to the authentication method specified in the predefined default-web-form object.
* default-web-form— To authenticate users, the firewall uses the certificate profile or authentication profile you specified
  when configuring Captive Portal. If you specified an authentication profile, the firewall ignores any Kerberos SSO settings in the
  profile and presents a Captive Portal page for the user to enter authentication credentials.
* default-no-captive-portal—The firewall evaluates Security policy without authenticating users.

Before creating a custom authentication enforcement object, you must configure a server profile that specifies how to connect to the
authentication service (Device > Server Profiles). Then, assign the server profile to an authentication profile that specifies authentication settings such as
Kerberos single sign-on parameters (Device > Authentication Profile).
