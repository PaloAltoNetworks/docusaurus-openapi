Manages address objects that allow you to reuse the same object as a source or destination address across all the policy rulebases
without having to add the address manually each time. An address object is an entity in which you can include IPv4 addresses, IPv6
addresses (a single IP address, a range of addresses, or a subnet) or FQDNs.
