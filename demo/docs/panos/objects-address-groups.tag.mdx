Manages address groups that simplify the creation of policy rules. If you have IP addresses or address objects
that require the same security settings, you can combine them into address groups. An address group can be static or dynamic.
* Dynamic Address Groups: A dynamic address group populates its members dynamically using looks ups for tags and tag-based filters.
Dynamic address groups are very useful if you have an extensive virtual infrastructure where changes in virtual
machine location/IP address are frequent. For example, you have a sophisticated failover setup or provision new
virtual machines frequently and would like to apply policy to traffic from or to the new machine without modifying
the configuration/rules on the firewall.
* Static Address Groups: A static address group can include address objects that are static, dynamic address groups, or
it can be a combination of both address objects and dynamic address groups.
