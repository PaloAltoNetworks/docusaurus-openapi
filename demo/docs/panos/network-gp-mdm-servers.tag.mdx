Configures the GlobalProtect gateway to communicate with a Mobile Device Management
(MDM) system.

If you are using an MDM system to manage end user mobile endpoints and you are using HIP-enabled policy
enforcement, you must configure the gateway to communicate with the MDM system to retrieve the HIP reports
for the managed endpoints.
