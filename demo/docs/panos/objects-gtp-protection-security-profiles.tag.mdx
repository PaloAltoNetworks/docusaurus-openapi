Manages GTP Protection security profiles used to inspect GTP traffic on firewalls with GTP Security enabled. The options in this profile
enable stateful inspection of GTP v1-C, GTP v2-C, and GTP-U, enable protocol validation for GTPv1-C, GTP v2-C and GTP-U, enable GTP-U content
inspection to scan user data within GTP-U tunnels. It also allows you to filter GTP sessions based on APN, IMSI-Prefix, and RAT, and prevent
end-user IP address spoofing to protect the mobile subscribers from being overbilled.
