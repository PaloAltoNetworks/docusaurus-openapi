Manages Decryption rules that allow the firewall to decrypt, inspect, and control inbound and outbound SSL and SSH connections.

In a Decryption policy you can specify what you want to traffic to decrypt by destination, source, service, or URL category,
and whether to block, restrict, or forward the traffic according to the security settings in the associated Decryption profile.
