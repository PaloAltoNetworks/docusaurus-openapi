Manages Denial of Service (DoS) rules. To protect your endpoints and resources in each security zone against
DoS attacks, these rules allow you to protect, deny, or allow packets that match a source interface, zone, address or user,
and/or a destination interface, zone, or user.

DoS Protection Profiles and policy rules work together to provide protection against flooding of many incoming SYN, UDP, ICMP,
and ICMPv6 packets, and other types of IP packets. A DoS Protection policy rule that is set to protect (rather than to allow or
deny packets) determines the criteria for packets to match (such as source address) in order to count toward the thresholds you
have defined in a DoS Protection Profile.
