Manages Decryption profiles which enable you to block and control specific aspects of SSL and SSH traffic that you have specified for decryption,
as well as traffic that you have explicitly excluded from decryption.
To enable a decryption profile, you can add the profile to a decryption policy; any traffic that matches the decryption policy is
additionally enforced based on the profile settings.
