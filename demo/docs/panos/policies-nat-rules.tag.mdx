Manages Network Address Translation (NAT) policy rules. These rules specify whether source or destination IP addresses and ports
are converted between public and private addresses and ports.

NAT rules are based on source and destination zones, source and destination addresses, and application service (such as HTTP).
Like security policies, NAT policy rules are compared sequentially against incoming traffic; the first rule that matches
the traffic is applied.
