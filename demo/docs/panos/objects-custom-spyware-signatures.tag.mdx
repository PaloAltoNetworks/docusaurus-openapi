Manages <a href="https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/objects/objects-custom-objects-spywarevulnerability.html">custom spyware signatures</a> used to identify spyware phone home communication. You can create custom
signatures by combining the signatures available on the firewall to create custom match conditions or
write custom regular expression patterns to identify spyware phone home communication or vulnerability exploits.
Content updates periodically include new decoders and contexts to help you develop custom signatures.

When you add the signature as a rule in an Anti-Spyware profile, and then attach the Anti-Spyware profile to a
Security policy rule, the firewall looks for the custom-defined patterns in network traffic and takes the specified action.
