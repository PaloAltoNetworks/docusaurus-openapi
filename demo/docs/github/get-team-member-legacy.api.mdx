## Get team member (Legacy)

:::caution deprecated

This endpoint has been deprecated and may be removed in future versions of the API.

:::

The &quot;Get team member&quot; endpoint (described below) is deprecated.

We recommend using the [Get team membership for a user](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/teams#get-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint instead. It allows you to get both active and pending memberships.

To list members in a team, the team must be visible to the authenticated user.
