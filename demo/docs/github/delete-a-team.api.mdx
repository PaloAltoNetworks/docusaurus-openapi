## Delete a team



To delete a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or team maintainer.

If you are an organization owner, deleting a parent team will delete all of its child teams as well.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `DELETE /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}`.
