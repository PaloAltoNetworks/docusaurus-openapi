## Revoke a grant for an application

:::caution deprecated

This endpoint has been deprecated and may be removed in future versions of the API.

**Deprecation Notice:** GitHub will discontinue OAuth endpoints that contain `access_token` in the path parameter. We have introduced new endpoints that allow you to securely manage tokens for OAuth Apps by moving `access_token` to the request body. For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/).

OAuth application owners can revoke a grant for their OAuth application and a specific user. You must use [Basic Authentication](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication) when accessing this endpoint, using the OAuth application&#39;s `client_id` and `client_secret` as the username and password. You must also provide a valid token as `:access_token` and the grant for the token&#39;s owner will be deleted.

Deleting an OAuth application&#39;s grant will also delete all OAuth tokens associated with the application for the user. Once deleted, the application will have no access to the user&#39;s account and will no longer be listed on [the Applications settings page under &quot;Authorized OAuth Apps&quot; on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications#authorized).
