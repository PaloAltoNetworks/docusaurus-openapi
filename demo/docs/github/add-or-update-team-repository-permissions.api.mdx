## Add or update team repository permissions



To add a repository to a team or update the team&#39;s permission on a repository, the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository, and must be able to see the team. The repository must be owned by the organization, or a direct fork of a repository owned by the organization. You will get a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status if you attempt to add a repository to a team that is not owned by the organization. Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you&#39;ll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see &quot;[HTTP verbs](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-verbs).&quot;

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `PUT /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.

For more information about the permission levels, see &quot;[Repository permission levels for an organization](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization)&quot;.
