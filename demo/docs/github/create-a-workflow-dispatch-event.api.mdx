## Create a workflow dispatch event



You can use this endpoint to manually trigger a GitHub Actions workflow run. You can replace `workflow_id` with the workflow file name. For example, you could use `main.yaml`.

You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow to run when the [`workflow_dispatch` webhook](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#workflow_dispatch) event occurs. The `inputs` are configured in the workflow file. For more information about how to configure the `workflow_dispatch` event in the workflow file, see &quot;[Events that trigger workflows](/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch).&quot;

You must authenticate using an access token with the `repo` scope to use this endpoint. GitHub Apps must have the `actions:write` permission to use this endpoint. For more information, see &quot;[Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).&quot;
