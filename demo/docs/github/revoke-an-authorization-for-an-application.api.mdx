**Deprecation Notice:** GitHub will discontinue OAuth endpoints that contain `access_token` in the path parameter. We have introduced new endpoints that allow you to securely manage tokens for OAuth Apps by moving `access_token` to the request body. For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/).

OAuth application owners can revoke a single token for an OAuth application. You must use [Basic Authentication](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication) when accessing this endpoint, using the OAuth application&#39;s `client_id` and `client_secret` as the username and password.
