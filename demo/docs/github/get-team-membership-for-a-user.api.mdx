## Get team membership for a user



Team members will include the members of child teams.

To get a user&#39;s membership with a team, the team must be visible to the authenticated user.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `GET /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.

**Note:** The `role` for organization owners returns as `maintainer`. For more information about `maintainer` roles, see [Create a team](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/teams#create-a-team).
