[DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes/) allows you to quickly deploy scalable and secure Kubernetes clusters. By sending requests to the `/v2/kubernetes/clusters` endpoint, you can list, create, or delete clusters as well as scale node pools up and down, recycle individual nodes, and retrieve the kubeconfig file for use with a cluster.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
