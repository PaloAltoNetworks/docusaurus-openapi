DigitalOcean offers the ability for you to create a [private container registry](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/container-registry/quickstart/) to store your Docker images for use with your Kubernetes clusters. This container registry runs inside the same datacenters as your cluster, ensuring reliable and performant rollout of image deployments.
You can only create one registry per DigitalOcean account, but you can use that registry to create as many repositories as you wish.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
