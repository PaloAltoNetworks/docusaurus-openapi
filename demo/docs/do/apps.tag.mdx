App Platform is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from DigitalOcean that allows developers to publish code directly to DigitalOcean servers without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
Most API operations are centered around a few core object types. Following are the definitions of these types. These definitions will be omitted from the operation-specific documentation.
For documentation on app specifications (`AppSpec` objects), please refer to the [product documentation](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/references/app-specification-reference/).



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
