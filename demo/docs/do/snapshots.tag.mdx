[Snapshots](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/) are saved instances of a Droplet or a block storage volume, which is reflected in the `resource_type` attribute. In order to avoid problems with compressing filesystems, each defines a `min_disk_size` attribute which is the minimum size of the Droplet or volume disk when creating a new resource from the saved snapshot.
To interact with snapshots, you will generally send requests to the snapshots endpoint at `/v2/snapshots`.



```mdx-code-block
