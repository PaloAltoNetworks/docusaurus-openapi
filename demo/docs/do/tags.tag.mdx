A tag is a label that can be applied to a resource (currently Droplets, Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and Database clusters) in order to better organize or facilitate the lookups and actions on it.
Tags have two attributes: a user defined `name` attribute and an embedded `resources` attribute with information about resources that have been tagged.
