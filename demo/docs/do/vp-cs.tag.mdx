[VPCs (virtual private clouds)](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/vpc/) allow you to create virtual networks containing resources that can communicate with each other in full isolation using private IP addresses.
By sending requests to the `/v2/vpcs` endpoint, you can create, configure, list, and delete custom VPCs as well as retrieve information about the resources assigned to them.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
