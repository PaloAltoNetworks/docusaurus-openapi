[DigitalOcean Block Storage Volumes](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/volumes/) provide expanded storage capacity for your Droplets and can be moved between Droplets within a specific region.
Volumes function as raw block devices, meaning they appear to the operating system as locally attached storage which can be formatted using any file system supported by the OS. They may be created in sizes from 1GiB to 16TiB.
By sending requests to the /v2/volumes endpoint, you can list, create, or delete volumes as well as attach and detach them from Droplets



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
