A DigitalOcean [image](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/) can be used to create a Droplet and may come in a number of flavors. Currently, there are five types of images: snapshots, backups, applications, distributions, and custom images.
* [Snapshots](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/) provide a full copy of an existing Droplet instance taken on demand.
* [Backups](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/backups/) are similar to snapshots but are created automatically at regular intervals when enabled for a Droplet.
* [Custom images](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/custom-images/) are Linux-based virtual machine images (raw, qcow2, vhdx, vdi, and vmdk formats are supported) that you may upload for use on DigitalOcean.
* Distributions are the public Linux distributions that are available to be used as a base to create Droplets.
* Applications, or [1-Click Apps](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/), are distributions pre-configured with additional software.
To interact with images, you will generally send requests to the images endpoint at /v2/images.
