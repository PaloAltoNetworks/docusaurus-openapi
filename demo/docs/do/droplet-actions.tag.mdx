Droplet actions are tasks that can be executed on a Droplet. These can be things like rebooting, resizing, snapshotting, etc.
Droplet action requests are generally targeted at one of the "actions" endpoints for a specific Droplet. The specific actions are usually initiated by sending a POST request with the action and arguments as parameters.
Droplet action requests create a Droplet actions object, which can be used to get information about the status of an action. Creating a Droplet action is asynchronous: the HTTP call will return the action object before the action has finished processing on the Droplet. The current status of an action can be retrieved from either the Droplet actions endpoint or the global actions endpoint. If a Droplet action is uncompleted it may block the creation of a subsequent action for that Droplet, the locked attribute of the Droplet will be true and attempts to create a Droplet action will fail with a status of 422.
