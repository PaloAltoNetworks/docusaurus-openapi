DigitalOcean's [managed database service](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases)
simplifies the creation and management of highly available database clusters. Currently, it
offers support for [PostgreSQL](http://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/),
[Redis](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/redis/),
[MySQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/mysql/), and
[MongoDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/mongodb/).

By sending requests to the `/v2/databases` endpoint, you can list, create, or delete
database clusters as well as scale the size of a cluster, add or remove read-only replicas,
and manage other configuration details.

The size of individual nodes in a database cluster is represented by a human-readable slug.
These slugs denote the underlying Droplet class, amount of RAM, and CPU count for the node.
Database clusters may be deployed in a multi-node, highly available configuration. In
addition to the primary node, up to two standby nodes may be added to a cluster with one
exception. High availability configurations are not available when using the smallest node
size. The currently available sizes and their corresponding slugs are:

Size Slug        | RAM   | CPU     | Storage | High Availability Plans
-----------------|-------|---------|---------|------------------------
db-s-1vcpu-1gb   | 1 GB  | 1 vCPU  | 10 GB   | False
db-s-1vcpu-2gb   | 2 GB  | 1 vCPU  | 25 GB   | True
db-s-2vcpu-4gb   | 4 GB  | 2 vCPU  | 38 GB   | True
db-s-4vcpu-8gb   | 8 GB  | 4 vCPU  | 115 GB  | True
db-s-6vcpu-16gb  | 16 GB | 6 vCPU  | 270 GB  | True
db-s-8vcpu-32gb  | 32 GB | 8 vCPU  | 580 GB  | True
db-s-16vcpu-64gb | 64 GB | 16 vCPU | 1.12 TB | True
