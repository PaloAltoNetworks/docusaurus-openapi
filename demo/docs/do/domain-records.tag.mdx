Domain record resources are used to set or retrieve information about the
individual DNS records configured for a domain. This allows you to build
and manage DNS zone files by adding and modifying individual records for a
domain.

The [DigitalOcean DNS management interface](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/)
allows you to configure the following DNS records:

Name  | Description                                                                                                                                        |
------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
A     | This record type is used to map an IPv4 address to a hostname.                                                                                     |
AAAA  | This record type is used to map an IPv6 address to a hostname.                                                                                     |
CAA   | As specified in RFC-6844, this record type can be used to restrict which certificate authorities are permitted to issue certificates for a domain. |
CNAME | This record type defines an alias for your canonical hostname (the one defined by an A or AAAA record).                                            |
MX    | This record type is used to define the mail exchanges used for the domain.                                                                         |
NS    | This record type defines the name servers that are used for this zone.                                                                             |
TXT   | This record type is used to associate a string of text with a hostname, primarily used for verification.                                           |
SRV   | This record type specifies the location (hostname and port number) of servers for specific services.                                               |
SOA   | This record type defines administrative information about the zone. Can only have ttl changed, cannot be deleted                                   |
