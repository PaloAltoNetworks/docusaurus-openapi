Domain resources are domain names that you have purchased from a domain name registrar that you are managing through the [DigitalOcean DNS interface](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/).
This resource establishes top-level control over each domain. Actions that affect individual domain records should be taken on the [Domain Records](#tag/Domain-Records) resource.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
