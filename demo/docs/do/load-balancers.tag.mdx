[DigitalOcean Load Balancers](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/load-balancers/) provide a way to distribute traffic across multiple Droplets. By sending requests to the `/v2/load_balancers` endpoint, you can list, create, or delete load balancers as well as add or remove Droplets, forwarding rules, and other configuration details.



```mdx-code-block

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
