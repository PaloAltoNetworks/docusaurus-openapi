Block storage actions are commands that can be given to a DigitalOcean Block Storage Volume. An example would be detaching or attaching a volume from a Droplet. These requests are made on the `/v2/volumes/$VOLUME_ID/actions` endpoint.
An action object is returned. These objects hold the current status of the requested action.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
