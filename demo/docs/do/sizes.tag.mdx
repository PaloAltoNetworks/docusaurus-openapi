The sizes objects represent different packages of hardware resources that can be used for Droplets. When a Droplet is created, a size must be selected so that the correct resources can be allocated.
Each size represents a plan that bundles together specific sets of resources. This includes the amount of RAM, the number of virtual CPUs, disk space, and transfer. The size object also includes the pricing details and the regions that the size is available in.
