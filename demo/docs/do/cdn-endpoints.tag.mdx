Content hosted in DigitalOcean's object storage solution, [Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/spaces/overview/), can optionally be served by our globally distributed Content Delivery Network (CDN). By sending requests to `/v2/cdn/endpoints`, you can list, create, or delete CDN Endpoints as well as purge cached content. To use a custom subdomain to access the CDN Endpoint, provide the ID of a DigitalOcean managed TLS certificate and the fully qualified domain name for the custom subdomain.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
