[DigitalOcean Cloud Firewalls](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/firewalls/) provide the ability to restrict network access to and from a Droplet allowing you to define which ports will accept inbound or outbound connections. By sending requests to the `/v2/firewalls` endpoint, you can list, create, or delete firewalls as well as modify access rules.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
