Projects allow you to organize your resources into groups that fit the way you work. You can group resources (like Droplets, Spaces, load balancers, domains, and floating IPs) in ways that align with the applications you host on DigitalOcean.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
