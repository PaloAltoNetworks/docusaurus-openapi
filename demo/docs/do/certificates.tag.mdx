In order to perform SSL termination on load balancers, DigitalOcean offers two types of [SSL certificate management](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/accounts/security/#certificates):
* **Custom**: User-generated certificates may be uploaded to DigitalOcean where they will be placed in a fully encrypted and isolated storage system.
* **Let's Encrypt**: Certificates may be automatically generated by DigitalOcean utilizing an integration with Let's Encrypt, the free and open certificate authority. These certificates will also be automatically renewed as required.
