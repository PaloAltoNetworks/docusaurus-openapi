[DigitalOcean Floating IPs](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/floating-ips/) are publicly-accessible static IP addresses that can be mapped to one of your Droplets. They can be used to create highly available setups or other configurations requiring movable addresses.
Floating IPs are bound to a specific region.
